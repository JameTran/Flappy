%This document describes the requirements for ....  The template for the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.  If you make further modifications to the template, you should explicitly state what modifications were made.

\textcolor{red}{This document highlights the Functional and Non-Functional Requirements for Mini-Arcade. This document will be used as a reference for future documents and during software development.}

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

\textcolor{red}{The purpose of our project is to provide players with} a seamless, satisfying experience when playing the mini games. Thus, we are focusing on making visual, functional and difficulty enhancements to a pre-existing set of mini games. \textcolor{red}{The mini games that will be recreated are Maze, Pong and Flappy.}

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

\subsubsection{The Client}

The clients for the product are Dr. Asghar Bokhari and the SFWRENG 3XA3 Teaching Assistants. As clients, they will administer the development of the product as well as offer assistance and clarification wherever possible. They will also determine the degree to what the product delivers on the requirements.

\subsubsection{The Customers}

The intended customers of the product are any individuals with the ability to download the product online. \sout{This includes a child, up to a senior citizen. The product is created to entertain its users and give them a joyful experience.} \textcolor{red}{There is no target demographic for this game, for it is available for anyone who is interested in playing some mini games.}

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}

All other stakeholders include all current developers as well as any future developers who wish to further improve upon the open-source project themselves.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

The system is to be built under the following constraints

\begin{itemize}
    \item The product must run successfully on at least Windows and MacOS.
    \item The product must be able to be run by running Launcher.py in the command line
    \item The product must not require any specialized hardware which the common user may not have.
    \item The product must be free of cost to all users.
    \item The product must be sufficiently complete by March 20, 2020.
    \item The product must contain at least \sout{one} \textcolor{red}{two} playable mini-games.
    \item Development cost of the product must not exceed \$0.
    \item The mini-game(s) must have a visual and/or difficulty improvement to be considered "updated".
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Mini-Game} - a simple game that can be played for a short or long amount of time.}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

\textcolor{red}{There will be approximately 2000 lines of code for the entire program. 5 main modules: Launcher, Scoreboard, Maze, Pong, Flappy, with 4 sub-modules per game}

It is assumed that the pygame and thorpy libraries are sufficient to update the mini games. Also, the mini games will be either visually enhanced or with new difficulty levels; both will be true only if time permits the developers to achieve this. \textcolor{red}{Other assumptions are that the user will have a working computer, understand English and is familiar with the use of a computer.}

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

The Current Situation:

Currently no launcher. To run the games you need to install the code from using Ubuntu, and running each game individually.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{red}{The launch a game you must first install the python freegames library using a command line}
    \item \textcolor{red}{You then must launch each game indvidually that you want to play.}
\end{itemize}

\textcolor{red}{The three games we are planning to modify are Maze, Flappy and Pong. These games are very simple with minimal functionality and poor performance.}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maze: a minimal 2-dimensional maze with one preset maze that is generated that can be navigated through single mouse clicks with little-to-no difficulty.
    \item Flappy: a simplistic game where the user utilizes the mouse-click to prevent their character from colliding with randomly generated objects, and loses when the collide
    \item Pong: a very simple version of the classic game Pong. It is a two-player game that has contains minimal physics aspect as well as poor graphics and poor performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This mini game launcher is developed for the course, SFWRENG 3XA3, professor Dr. Asghar Bokahri and the teaching assistants assigned to our group, Thien Tandinh and Oluwaseum Owojaiye.
    \item \textcolor{red}{Before development, we will need to create several documents to effectively plan out the project. These documents include: the Test Plan, the Development Plan, the Module Guide and the Module Interface Specification.}
    \item \textcolor{red}{We will need to re-develop and add additional functionality to the Maze, Pong and Flappy game}
    \item \textcolor{red}{We will also develop a launcher that contains a scoreboard, and acts as a central hub for the user to access and easily run any of the developed mini-games.}
\end{itemize}

This section is not in the original Volere template, but health and safety are
issues that should be considered for every engineering project.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}

The following describes issues that has been raised , but have not yet solved:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The current program is still in the form of python scripts, which make it relatively hard for beginners to run the game (due to the need to installing 2 external libraries). Therefore, it would be easier for access if it is compiled into a standalone executable. But this require the use of external libraries and also there will be problems with reading and writing files in standalone executable.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

As some of the mini-games are based on commonly spread ideas, there is a decent amount of similar games out there, such as pac-man, flappy bird, pong, etc.

\subsection{New Problems}

Our project provide a all-in-one package to some of the common mini-games, with a launcher providing access to multiple common mini-games without the need of internet connection on computers.

\subsection{Tasks}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c| } 
\hline
\textbf{Task} & \textbf{Timeline}\\
\hline
Launcher Model Implementation and  & February 13\textsuperscript{th}\\

\hline
Launcher Development and Game Remake & March 15\textsuperscript{th}\\
\hline
Testing and Revision & March 29\textsuperscript{th}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textcolor{white}{...}\\ %remove awkward indent
Task 1: Basic model for launcher and partially modify the mini-game to adapt with new graphic library (at least modify the main menu).\\
Task 2: Finish the adaptation to the new graphic library.\\
Task 3: Finish development of the launcher and remake the mini-games to provide more functionality to each mini-game.\\
Task 4: Test the launcher and mini-game, fix bugs found during testing and optimizes the mini-games.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}

Not applicable.

\subsection{Risks}

Risks are inherent in the development of any product. The following information highlights possible risks for this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complexity of Graphic Library
    \item Over-estimated Project Size
    \item Difficult Testing
    \item Bad Programming Practices
    \item Improper Git Usage
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costs}

There is no monetary cost to this project as all resources are free of charge. The original code this project is based on is a open-source project, and all technologies required in the development of the project such as graphic libraries and programming tools are all free, resulting in no monetary cost.\\
The labour cost required for this project is relatively high, as each team member will require to dedicate around 5 to 7 hours minimum per week in the development of this project.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}

Inside the project, there will be a README.MD file inside the repository which contains the information
With each mini-game having different controls and playing method, there will be a help section integrated into each mini-game containing help information.

\subsection{Waiting Room}

As this project only re-made part of the mini-games in the original open source project, the future plan will be remaking all mini-games in the original open source project and integrate them into the launcher.

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

The following are purposed solution to some of the issues stated in section 4.1:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pyinstaller is a library that can compile python script into a standalone executable. The use of library is still pending due to the need of further investigation of the library to determine if it meets all of our need.
\end{itemize}
