\section{Team Meeting Plan}

Typical meetings will occur during lab time on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9:30am - 11:20 am in room 236 in the Information Technology Building on campus. These meetings will occur weekly with the exceptions of breaks. During these meetings, Arshan leads the group as project manager, however, the group works as equals to assign appropriate work to each individual. If there is work left uncompleted after our allocated meeting slots, additional meetings will be scheduled amongst the team members. The individual in charge of the meeting agenda will switch each meeting and be in charge of recording minutes, written statement on decisions made and homework designations.

\section{Team Communication Plan}

The teams primary means of communication is through a group chat on Facebook. This allows easy communication to the entire group, as well as individual conversations if needed. For issues related to the software, we may use Git Issues to notify one another on current issues that need resolving. Each group member can contact one another through email if necessary.
