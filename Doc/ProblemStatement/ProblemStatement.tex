\section{Problem Statement}
\subsection{What is the problem to be solved?}
The purpose of any game is to entertain the user. However, the term entertain is broad with many interpretations and meaning based on each individual. Our team believes that the core purpose of a good game is to bring joy to the players, leaving them with a desire to play longer. To achieve this, we believe a game should be easily accessible, pose a challenge to the user to provide a feeling of accomplishment when overcome and be aesthetically pleasing. The selections of mini-games we currently have are simple with minimal functionality. We want to enhance these preexisting games and develop a central hub to access these games.

\subsection{Why is this problem important?}
The mini-games in their current state are difficult to launch, decreasing the appeal to play them. Alongside the difficulty to play, the mini-games have 

\subsection{What is the problems context?}

Redesign simple Python games to increase the graphics and complexity.
Alongside the redesign, there will be a new launcher. 

- A clear concise description of the issues that need to be addressed by your team
- What problem are you trying to solve? Not how you are going to solve the problem

Currently, we have a collection of very simple mini games that can be played by launching each game individually. These games have 
low graphics quality, minimal features and poor user interface. To play a game, you have to launch them using a Linux subsystem, and each
game must be launched individually.

- Why is this an important problem?

It is a universal fact that games should be entertaining, with smooth performance. We want these simple mini games to provide said
entertainment to the users, as well as ease of access.

- What is the context of the problem you are solving?
	- Stakeholders?
	- Software environment?
